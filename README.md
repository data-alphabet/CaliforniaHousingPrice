# California Housing Price Data Analysis Demo

## Project Description
This is a data analysis demo to learn the process of data analysis with **Python**. In this project, I experienced data fetching, exploratory data analysis, feature engeneering, data preprocessing, data visulization, data modeling and so on. It is really an iteresting learning experience! All the source codes own detailed notes, so you can read them easily!

- 地理信息可视化.xlsx

I try to visulize the geographic information by the Excel plug-in —— PowerMap! And I transform it into a short cute vedio file —— 地理信息可视化.mp4.

- DownloadData.py

It is a module to fetch dataset's raw file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron-ml/master/ . This module mainly solve problems in data fetching and storing. It used Python's os, tarfile and six.moves.urlib!

- EDA.py

It is the module for exploratory data analysis. I can be familiar with the data as soon as quickly by knowing the distribution of data, the missing values of attributes, the data sample of dataset! It used API in Python's pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and os!
